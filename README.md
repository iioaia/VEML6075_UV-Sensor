My Python Learning Experience

My objective is to learn about Python and make something I think is interesting. Armed with my the Internet and my willpower I set off to learn how to program, for the first time since highschool.

Using a VEML6075 UV sensor to collect UV data that will then be displayed on a Unicornhat HD 16x16 LED panel.


# my setup

Tall 40 pin GPIO addon (to raise it all above heatsink)
