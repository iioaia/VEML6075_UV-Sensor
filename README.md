My Python Learning Experience

My objective is to learn about Python and make something I think is interesting.

Using a VEML6075 UV sensor to collect UV data that will then be displayed on a Unicornhat HD 16x16 LED panel.


# my setup
Raspberry Pi 3
Tall 40 pin GPIO addon (to raise it all above heatsink)
GPIO expansion Hat (3 extra sets of 40 pin GPIO).
